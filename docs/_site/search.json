    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nIn SQL, a database is a system that stores and organises multiple sets of related data. It typically contains several tables, each of which is a structured collection of data arranged in rows and columns. For instance, a ‘School’ database might contain separate tables for ‘Students’, ‘Teachers’, and ‘Classes’. Each table would store specific information: the ‘Students’ table might have columns for student ID, name, and year group, with each row representing an individual student’s details. Databases can also contain objects other than tables, such as views (virtual tables used for data retrieval), indexes (optimised data structures for faster data retrieval), and stored procedures (predefined SQL queries that can be reused). While databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), such as PostgreSQL, and handle overall data organisation and integrity, tables are manipulated using SQL commands for specific data operations within their structure, as we will see below.↩︎"

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing platform that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations, and narrative text. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text, and can be used for everything - websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation. Even WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger use Markdown to format messages. So if you have already italicised a word or made a text bold on WhatsApp, you have used Markdown!\nThis tutorial is divided into two parts. The first part will introduce you to Jupyter Notebook and show you how to create a new notebook, run code cells, and format text cells using Markdown. The second part will provide a more in-depth look at Markdown and show you how to create headings, lists, links, images, and tables."

Jupyter Notebook supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia. Jupyter Notebook is widely used in data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and other fields.\nJupyter Notebooks provide an interactive development environment that allows you to write and execute code, see the results immediately, and create reproducible analyses. Jupyter Notebooks are organized into cells, which can contain code, text, equations, or visualisations. You can run individual cells or the entire notebook, and you can save your work as a notebook file (.ipynb) that can be shared with others."

You will see a prompt in the middle of the screen. Select the option “Jupyter Notebook”.\n\n\n\nCreating a new Jupyter Notebook in VSCode.\n\n\nA new Jupyter Notebook will be created with the file extension .ipynb. You can rename the notebook by clicking on the notebook name at the top of the screen. An empty notebook will look like this:\n\n\n\nAn empty Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\nPlease do not forget to select the Python interpreter that you want to use for the notebook. You can do this by clicking on the Python version at the top right corner of the screen. A prompt will appear, and you can select the Python interpreter that you want to use (in this case, Anacoda’s “base”).\n\n\n\nSelecting the Python interpreter for the notebook.\n\n\nTo create a chunk of Python code click on “+ Code.” You will get an empty gray box which has Python on the lower-right corner. You can type Python code in this box and run it by clicking on the “Run” button on the left side of the box. You can also run the code by pressing “Shift + Enter” on your keyboard.\n\n\n\nA code cell in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\nHere you should enter the Python commands. For example, type the following lines of code in the code cell:\n\nprint(\"Welcome to QTM 151!\")\n\nx = 5\ny = 10\nz = x + y\nprint(z)\n\nThe results of the code will be displayed below the code cell. In this case, the output will be:\n\n\n\nOutput of the code cell.\n\n\nTo create a text cell click on “+ Markdown.” You will get an empty white box where you can type text. We will cover Markdown in more detail in the next section. But for now, you can type the following text in the Markdown cell:\n# Welcome to QTM 151!\n\nThis is a Jupyter Notebook. You can write *text*, **equations**, and `code` \nin [this notebook](https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm151/blob/main/tutorials/testing-ipython.ipynb). \nThe text will be displayed in the text cell like this:\n\n\n\nA text cell in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\nYou can run the text cell by clicking the “Run” button on the left side of the box or by pressing “Shift + Enter” on your keyboard. The first text block shows how the text looks before running the cell, and the second block shows how it looks after running the cell. Just double click on the space where the text is to edit the Markdown block. This is should open the gray box again."

    "section": "3.5 Creating Markdown Tables from Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebooks",
    "text": "3.5 Creating Markdown Tables from Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebooks\nWhen working with pandas DataFrames, you can convert them into Markdown tables for better presentation. The method is also relatively simple. Here is how to do it:\n\n3.5.1 Prerequisites\nEnsure you have the following installed:\n\nJupyter Notebook\npandas\ntabulate (for enhanced table formatting)\n\nJupyter Notebook and pandas are included in the Anaconda distribution. You can install tabulate using conda install in your terminal. If you are using VS Code, you can open a terminal by clicking on “Terminal” &gt; “New Terminal” in the top menu. Then run the following command:\nconda install tabulate\n\n\n3.5.2 Basic Method: Using pandas.DataFrame.to_markdown()\npandas provides a built-in method to_markdown() for converting DataFrames to Markdown tables.\n\n3.5.2.1 Step 1: Import pandas and create a DataFrame\nYou can create a dataframe by passing a dictionary to the pd.DataFrame() constructor:\n\n# If necessary, install pandas and tabulate \n# You should have pandas installed if you installed Anaconda, \n# but if you do not, you can install both with the following terminal command:\n# conda install pandas tabulate\n\n# Import pandas\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    \"Name\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"],\n    \"Age\": [25, 30, 35],\n    \"City\": [\"New York\", \"London\", \"Paris\"]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n\n\n3.5.2.2 Step 2: Convert DataFrame to Markdown\nThen you just need to call the to_markdown() method on the DataFrame:\n\n# Print the DataFrame as a Markdown table, excluding the index\nmarkdown_table = df.to_markdown(index=False)\nprint(markdown_table)\n\nThis will output:\n| Name    | Age  | City     |\n|:--------|-----:|:---------|\n| Alice   |   25 | New York |\n| Bob     |   30 | London   |\n| Charlie |   35 | Paris    |\n\n\n3.5.2.3 Step 3: Display in Jupyter Notebook\nTo display the Markdown table in a Jupyter Notebook cell, use the display() function from the IPython.display module:\n\n# You should also have the IPython package installed if you installed Anaconda\n# If not, you can install it with\n# conda install ipython\n\n# Import the Markdown display class. \n# This is what allows us to display Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks \nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\n\n# Display the Markdown table\ndisplay(Markdown(markdown_table))\n\nThis will render a nicely formatted table in your notebook:\n\n\n\nMarkdown table in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Advanced Formatting\nYou can customise the Markdown table using various parameters of to_markdown():\n\n# Customising the Markdown table using the to_markdown() method\nmarkdown_table = df.to_markdown(\n    index=False,  # Don't include index\n    tablefmt=\"pipe\",  # Use pipe format\n    floatfmt=\".2f\",  # Format floats to 2 decimal places\n    headers=[\"Name\", \"Age (Years)\", \"City\"],  # Custom headers\n    colalign=(\"left\", \"center\", \"right\")  # Align columns\n)\ndisplay(Markdown(markdown_table))\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Using tabulate for Enhanced Formatting\nThe tabulate library offers even more formatting options. While they are not necessary for basic tables, they can be useful for more complex tables. In our course, you will probably not need them, but I will show you how to use them for your reference. Please check their documentation for more information.\n\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\nmarkdown_table = tabulate(df, headers='keys', tablefmt='pipe', showindex=False)\ndisplay(Markdown(markdown_table))\n\n\n\n3.5.5 Best Practices\n\nIndex: Consider whether you need the index in your table. Often, it is cleaner to exclude it using index=False.\nFormatting: Use floatfmt to control decimal places for numerical data.\nHeaders: Customize headers for clarity, especially if your DataFrame column names are not user-friendly.\nTable Format: Experiment with different tablefmt options to find the most suitable for your needs.\nLarge DataFrames: For large DataFrames, consider displaying only a subset of rows or columns to maintain readability.\n\n\n\n3.5.6 Example: Comprehensive Table Creation\nHere is a more comprehensive example incorporating various best practices:\n\n# Import necessary packages\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    \"Product\": [\"Laptop\", \"Smartphone\", \"Tablet\"],\n    \"Price\": [999.99, 599.50, 299.75],\n    \"Stock\": [50, 100, 75],\n    \"Rating\": [4.5, 4.8, 4.2]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Create a formatted Markdown table\nmarkdown_table = tabulate(\n    df,\n    headers=[\"Product Name\", \"Price ($)\", \"Stock Quantity\", \"Customer Rating\"],\n    tablefmt=\"pipe\", # Format as Markdown table\n    floatfmt=(\".2f\", \".2f\", \"d\", \".1f\"),\n    showindex=False, # Don't show the index (row numbers)\n    numalign=\"right\", # Align numbers to the right\n    stralign=\"left\" # Align strings (text, first column) to the left\n)\n\n# Display the table in the notebook\ndisplay(Markdown(\"### Product Inventory Summary\"))\ndisplay(Markdown(markdown_table))\n\nThis will produce a well-formatted table with custom headers, appropriate number formatting, and a title.\n\n\n\nComprehensive Markdown table in a Jupyter Notebook."

The two packages I know that manage citations, cite2c and Jupyterlab Citation Manager, are not ideal. The first has not been maintained for years, while the second is not ready for most uses. Therefore, I suggest simply copying the citation from Google Scholar and pasting it into a Markdown cell titled “References” at the end of your document.
