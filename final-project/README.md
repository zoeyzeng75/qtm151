# Final Project Instructions

This folder contains the instructions for the final project of the course. The final project is a group project, where you will work in groups of 3-4 students. The project is due on the last day of class, and it is worth 20% of your final grade.

Please read the `final-project.pdf` file for detailed instructions on the project. The `data-raw` folder contains the data files you will use, and the data documentation is in the `documentation` folder.
